  <description brief="track_tools">

    This package is for working with track data that accompanies the paper "Towards 3D Object Recognition via Classification of Arbitrary Object Tracks", in ICRA2011.  Please direct questions, bug reports, comments, etc. to teichman@cs.stanford.edu.  If you're using this data, I'd love to hear what you're up to - feel free to drop me a line.

    Known issues:
    - sensor_msgs::PointCloud is deprecated.  The track data should be ported to the new point cloud format.
