This code implements the min-cut/max-flow algorithm described in:

An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy
Minimization in Vision

Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov

This implementation follows the algorithm described in the paper but
has some additional optimizations that increase speed and save
memory for vision problems. Although tuned for neighbor relations such
as those found in vision, it also works on general graph structures.

This code it presents the fundamental data structure of the BKGraph
which can be initialized for generic graphs and have the maxflow
computed on it. It should be quite straightforward to use.

This code has been tested on x86 Linux machines and Windows 2000. It
should work on all platforms. If you cannot get it to work on your
platform, please let me know, as I'd like it to be available to anyone
who would like to use it.

I have only included code to the graph cut algorithm because I
couldn't think of a useful suitable driver program. If you have a good
idea for a generic driver program, please let me know.

There are no restrictions on this software, but I would appreciate bug
reports and as well as information as to how people are using this code.
