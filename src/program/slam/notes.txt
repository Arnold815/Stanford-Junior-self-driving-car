Current process to correct a set of logfiles:
---------------------------------------------

First, make sure that your Velodyne logfiles have index files.  You
can generate index files by running vlf_index.  The index files will
have the same names as the vlf files with .index.gz tacked on the end.

vlf_index data.log.gz data.vlf

1.  Create a config file.  The config file is a text file that
describes the inputs to the SLAM programs.  The first line is the
number of logfile paths (N).  The next N lines are paths to look for
logfiles.  The next line is the number of DGC/VLF logfile pairs (M).
The next M lines contain the logfile name, the vlf logfile name, and
then a zero or one describing whether or not to optimize this
trajectory.  example-config.txt is a simple example config file.

1.  Run find_overlap to locate places to do scanmatching.  This will
generate a match-file.

./find_overlap config.txt matchfile.txt

3.  Run match_scans to do scan matching for each of the matches in the
matchfile.  This will update the match file.

./match_scans config.txt matchfile.txt 

4.  Run correct_indexes to generated fixed index files.

./correct_indexes config.txt matchfile.txt

5.  Run correct_logfiles config.txt to generate fixed versions of the
original .log.gz files.

./correct_logfiles config.txt
