HCI Module
----------
This module handles HCI issues.  Right now it plays sound files through
the audio card based on dgc_hci_audio ipc messages to alert the driver.

-----
Files
-----
development/src/program/hci - module that plays audio
development/src/program/hci/sounds - where sound clips live
development/src/program/hci/sound-config.txt - specifies available sounds
development/src/interface/hci - functions to use hci module

---------------------
Compiling and Running
---------------------
This module uses SDL and SDL_mixer libraries to play audio.  These should
be easy to install using the package managers in Ubuntu or Fedora.  They
are named:
  libsdl1.2-dev
  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
in Ubuntu and
  SDL-devel
  SDL_mixer-devel
in Fedora.

Type make in development/src/program/hci and development/src/interface/hci
to compile the module and interface

To run the module just type ./hci from driving/bin.  Also, do not run any
other audio software (like mplayer or xmms) at the same time, as Linux will
not allow the module to grab the sound card.  If you see output from the
module of "Failed to initialize audio" it's probably due to something else
using the audio card (or sound is just not working at all).

-----
Usage
-----
Using the hci module is easy, just send it strings to speak with dgc_hci_send_audio.
The string consists of tokens, separated by whitespace, that the module
will use to lookup sound clips to play.  This is a very simple poor-man's text
to speech system.  For example:

(add -lhci_interface in Makefile)
#include <hci_interface.h>
...
dgc_hci_send_audio("warning returnlane 4");
...

Will make the module say "warning, returned to lane four".  The available sound clips
and their keys are specified in sound-config.txt.  This file lists key/file path
pairs (paths are relative to /bin) :

warning   ../development/src/program/hci/sounds/warning.ogg
2         ../development/src/program/hci/sounds/two.ogg
3         ../development/src/program/hci/sounds/three.ogg

To add new sound clips of your own, just edit this file.  Use oggenc to convert
.wav to .ogg to save space.

-----
Notes
-----
The HCI module will ignore any string tokens that it does not find a corresponding
sound clip for.  Also it will completely speak one message before speaking the
next one.  The module will also throw away duplicate messages while the same message
is playing, so if you send 20 identical messages in one second, but the message
actually takes a few seconds to play, then the message will only get spoken once.

Numbers with more then one digit will be split and spoken one digit at a time, so
"65" will be spoken as "six five".  Hope to improve this later.
