Shape tables
-------------
For use with [RACE_ROOT]/src/program/traffic_lights/image_data.cpp.
Holds binary lookup table data for traffic light hue or saturation in the following format:

[uint16] minimum lookup input
[uint16] maximum lookup input
[double] output gain
[array of type given by file extension... eg: uint8] table data (usually a histogram)

These files describe histograms created with the matlab function 
[RACE_ROOT]/src/program/traffic_lights/create_hsv_tables.m
which searches the directories ./red_lights/ ./ylw_lights/ ./grn_lights/ 
for png files of actual traffic lights from log files. 

To create these png files:
	- run traffic_light_notify with the debug [D] option
	- click in the gui window
	- type 'r' to begin recording frames where traffic lights are requested
	- type 'r' again to stop recording
	- use an image editor to crop .hsv.png files to just around the traffic light
	- save each cropped light as a png file in either grn_lights/ red_lights/ or ylw_lights/
	- run the matlab function create_hsv_tables.m
	- store the resulting files in [RACE_ROOT]/param/hsv-tables/

These files are eventually processed by [RACE_ROOT]/src/program/traffic_lights/ShapeTable.h.
